Social Choice Theory
===========
This script for the lecture 'Social Choice Theory' held by Prof. Dr. Puppe at the KIT during summer course 2016 was created by students and is therefore unofficial. It contains most likely mistakes (typos, copy errors or comprehension problems) since it is a work in progress - I call on your understanding.

Please submit all improvement and suggestions either via email or push them directly into the script on Github, i.e.
* either directly implemented via pull/push or
* sent by mail (MBelica@hmamail.com).

I'm going to try to implement all notes and suggestions as soon as possible.

**With your help we can create good lecture notes.**
